# ðŸš€ Simple HTTP Proxy Server (Windows)

A multi-threaded **HTTP proxy server written in C for Windows**, leveraging Winsock2.  
Handles client requests, forwards them to external servers, and logs detailed activity â€” with built-in security measures to block suspicious or unsafe requests.

---

## âœ¨ Features

### âœ… Proxy Core
- Listens on **TCP port `8080`**.
- Handles multiple clients concurrently using Windows `_beginthreadex` threads.
- Receives HTTP requests (supports `GET` and `POST`), forwards them to the target host, and relays responses.

### âœ… Security & Stability
- **Blocks requests** to:
  - `localhost`
  - `127.0.1`
  - `192.168.*.*`
  - `10.*.*.*`
- **Rejects oversized requests** (>4095 bytes) to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
- Designed to guard against DNS rebinding and basic misuse.

### âœ… Monitoring & Logging
- Logs:
  - Client connections (IP & port).
  - Total requests handled.
  - Number of blocked requests.
  - Active threads count (live connections).
  - Forwarded hosts.
- Prints full HTTP request received from client.
